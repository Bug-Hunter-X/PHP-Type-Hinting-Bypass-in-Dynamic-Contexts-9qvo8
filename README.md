This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in PHP related to type hinting. The `foo` function is type hinted to accept integers, but the `bar` function implicitly passes the return value to `echo`, which doesn't strictly enforce the integer type. This could lead to unexpected behavior if `foo` were to ever return a non-integer value (due to unforeseen circumstances or future changes).  The `bugSolution.php` demonstrates a more robust way to handle this.
